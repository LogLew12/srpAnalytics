When 1,4-dichlorobenzene is heated to decomposition, toxic gases and vapors (such as hydrochloric acid and carbon monoxide) are released. The primary route of potential human exposure to this compound is inhalation. Acute inhalation exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene can result in coughing and breathing difficulties. Breathing high levels of this chemical can cause headaches, dizziness and liver damage. Contact with 1,4-dichlorobenzene can irritate the eyes, leading to burning and tearing.

The chronic (long-term) effects in workers exposed to o-toluidine include anemia, anorexia, weight loss, skin lesions, central nervous system depression, cyanosis, and methemoglobinemia. Animal studies indicate that chronic exposure too-toluidine causes effects on the spleen, liver, urinary bladder, and blood.

Ethylene thiourea has been shown to be a potent teratogen (causes birth defects) in rats orally or dermally exposed. A study of female workers occupationally exposed to ethylene thiourea did not report an increased incidence of thyroid cancer. In a study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), an increased incidence of thyroid tumors in rats, and thyroid, liver, and pituitary gland tumors in mice exposed to ethylene thiourea were noted.
