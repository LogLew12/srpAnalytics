Exposure to nitrobenzene irritates the skin, eyes and respiratory tract and can result in methemoglobinemia causing fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, disturbed vision, shortness of breath, collapse and even death. Nitrobenzene also damages the liver, spleen, kidneys and central nervous system. This substance is a possible mutagen and is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.","2371","Total mortality","Total mortality (aggregation of MO24 + MORT)","http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000071","Poor"
