conda activate tox
(for Doonam, it is conda activate tox where some dependencies are installed like statsmodels)


jupyter-lab
(launching jupyter-lab without activating tox conda environment causes a difficult error)
(confirmed) scipy 1.4.1 runs well but newer version (1.5.x) doesnâ€™t work


To reflect new changes in importing files in wrapper (like generate_dose_response.py), restarting kernel is needed.
