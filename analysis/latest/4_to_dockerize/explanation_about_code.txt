For speed purpose (fast development of code),

lines of 150,151
2_qc_BMD/Main_Wrapper_BMD_Analysis_7_PAHs.py 

are

end_points = ['ANY24','CRAN']


For full running (slow), it needs to be
end_points = ['ANY24','ANY120','AXIS','ALL_BUT_MORT','BRN_','CRAN','DP24','EDEM','LTRK','MO24','MORT','MUSC','NC__', 'SKIN','SM24','TCHR','TOT_MORT']
